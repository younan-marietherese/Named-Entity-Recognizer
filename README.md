# Named Entity Recognition (NER) for Arabic Text

This project focuses on developing a Named Entity Recognizer (NER) for Arabic text, either using a rule-based method or a machine learning model. Named entity recognition is a key task in natural language processing (NLP) that involves identifying and classifying named entities like persons, locations, organizations, and more within text.

## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to build an Arabic NER system using an annotated corpus. Named Entity Recognition (NER) is crucial for extracting structured information from unstructured text. This project explores methods to identify entities in Arabic text, including preprocessing steps like tokenization and lemmatization, and builds an NER system based on the annotated data.

The project includes:
1. Loading an Arabic corpus and preprocessing it.
2. Developing an NER system using either rule-based methods or machine learning.
3. Evaluating the model based on metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Objectives
- Load or create an Arabic corpus with manually labeled named entities.
- Preprocess the text by applying regex, tokenization, and lemmatization.
- Develop an NER model (rule-based or machine learning-based).
- Evaluate the model using standard metrics like accuracy and recall.

---

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: For implementing the NER system.
- **Pandas**: For loading and processing the dataset.
- **Scikit-learn**: For building and evaluating the machine learning models.
- **Regular Expressions (Regex)**: For preprocessing the text.
- **NLTK/Spacy**: For tokenization and other NLP tasks.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is an Arabic corpus, which may be created manually or obtained from an external source. It contains several sentences with labeled named entities, such as:
- **Persons**
- **Locations**
- **Organizations**

Each sentence in the dataset is manually annotated to mark the named entities.

## Key Steps

1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Load the corpus into a DataFrame.
   - Apply preprocessing techniques such as removing punctuation, tokenizing the sentences, and lemmatizing the words.

2. **NER Development**:
   - Develop a Named Entity Recognition system, either:
     - **Rule-Based**: Create rules using patterns and regular expressions to identify named entities.
     - **Machine Learning-Based**: Train a predictive model on the labeled dataset.

3. **Evaluation**:
   - Evaluate the NER model using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
   - Analyze the performance of the model and discuss areas for improvement.
